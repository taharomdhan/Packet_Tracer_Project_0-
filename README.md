# Packet_Tracer_Project_0-

Hello ! 

This is my first project in a series of projects 
it's a packet tracer networking topology where we test connectivity between two subnets (two departments): 

- first department is Accounts 

- second department is Delivery 

Each subnet is composed of 2PCS a printer connected via a switch 
I configured the ip addresses to make connectivity possible between subnets 
You can find a picture of the topology if you don't have packet tracer
